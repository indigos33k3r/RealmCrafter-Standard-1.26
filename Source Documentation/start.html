		<title>Realm Crafter Pro Documentation</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<p>Warning: It is assumed at this point that you have a basic knowledge of the Blitz3D/BlitzPlus programming
		languages. If not, you should refer to the Blitz documentation and community for help in learning
		the language.</p>

		<p>Realm Crafter is essentially split into two seperate programs -- the client and the server. When you compile
		the code you must open <i>Default Project.bb</i> (the client) in Blitz3D and <i>Server.bp</i> in BlitzPlus. As
		a general rule, all files intended to be opened in BlitzPlus use a <b>.bp</b> extension, and all files intended
		for Blitz3D have a <b>.bb</b> extension. Files which are used by both use <b>.bb</b>. These two files are the
		ones present in the root folder of your project. All files in the \Modules folder (which make up most of the code)
		are used as Include files by <i>Default Project.bb</i> and <i>Server.bp</i>.<p>

		<p>Tips and tricks:
			<ul>
				<li>Running the client in debug mode will automatically use windowed graphics</li>
				<li>In this mode it is possible to run multiple clients on a single PC</li>
				<li>The server runs extremely slowly in debug mode, use it as little as possible</li>
				<li>In the code, abilities are usually referred to as spells, and zones as areas</li>
				<li>Add more here as I think of them</li>
			</ul>
