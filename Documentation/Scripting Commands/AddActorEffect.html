<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		AddActorEffect(Actor, Effect, Attribute, Value, Time, IconID)</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The AddActorEffect command creates an icon on a player's screen for a specified
	amount of time. You may also choose one attribute to affect for the duration,
	but other effects are up to you to script. This is useful for spells which
	have a temporary effect, traps, diseases, powerups and other effects. If you
	add an effect with the same name twice, the effect duration will be extended,
	but the icon will not appear twice on the player's screen. <br>
	The Effect parameter is the name you wish to give to the effect. This is displayed
	to the player when they hover the mouse over the icon on their screen. The Attribute
	is the name of an attribute to alter for the duration of the effect, and can be left
	blank if you do not wish to affect any attribute. The Value is the amount to change
	the attribute by, and can be positive negative. Time is the length of time (in
	seconds) for which the effect will last. IconID is the ID number of the texture
	to use for the effect icon.
