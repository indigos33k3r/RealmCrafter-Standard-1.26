<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		SetOwner(Actor, ZoneName, SceneryID, [Instance])</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The SetOwner command sets the actor who 'own' a specified scenery object. Scenery IDs
	are set in the zones editor - scenery must be set to 'ownable' before this command can
	be used. The optional Instance parameter allows you to set the object owner in any extra
	instance of the zone created with <a href="CreateZoneInstance.html">CreateZoneInstance</a>. <br><br>
	When an actor owns some scenery, only that actor has access to the scenery inventory,
	and if it is set to animate when selected, only that actor may select the scenery and cause
	it to animate. This command is useful to allow players to buy houses, storage chests etc. which
	only they can use.

		Function Main()
			; Give house number 22 to the actor
			SetOwner(Actor(), "Tilbury Town", 22)
			Return()
		End Function
	</pre>
