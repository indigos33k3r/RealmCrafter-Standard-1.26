<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		CreateZoneInstance(Zone, [Instance])</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The CreateZoneInstance command creates an extra instance of a zone. Instances
	are given IDs from 0 to 99, with #0 being the default instance, which always
	exists. Extra instances of a zone all look and behave exactly like the
	default instance, but have their own seperate players, NPCs, dropped items,
	and player owned scenery. This means that a player in instance #2 of a zone
	would effectively be in a different zone to a player in instance #1, even
	though they are both in the same zone. <br>
	There are many uses for this command. For example; to split players up when
	zones become too densely populated, to avoid overloading the server, clients
	or network, and keep performance at an acceptable level. <br>
	This command will return the ID of the newly created instance, or 0 if a new
	instance could not be created. <br>
	The optional Instance parameter allows you to request a specific instance ID
	for the new instance. If it is not available, the instance will not be created
	and 0 will be returned. <br>
	Once created, an instance will continue to exist until either it is removed with
	<a href="RemoveZoneInstance.html">RemoveZoneInstance</a>, or the server is restarted
	while the instance contains no dropped items or owned scenery. Instances which
	do have dropped items, player owned scenery, or scenery containing items, will
	be saved when the server is closed and reloaded at startup.
