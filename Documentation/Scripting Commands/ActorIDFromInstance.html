<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		ActorIDFromInstance(Actor)</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The ActorIDFromInstance command returns an ID number representing a particular race/class actor
	combination. These IDs are set when an actor is created in the main editor, and do
	not change. These IDs can then be used with other scripting commands, such as
	<a href="WaitKill.html">WaitKill</a> and <a href="Spawn.html">Spawn</a>. <br>
	The difference between this command and <a href="ActorID.html">ActorID</a> is that instead
	of specifying the race and class for the actor ID to be returned, you specify an existing
	actor instance (e.g. a player or NPC), and the ID of the actor it is based on will be
	returned.

<p>
	<b>Example:</b> <br>
	<pre>
		Function Main()
			Player = Actor()

			; Turn the player into a wolf
			OldID = ActorIDFromInstance(Player)
			ID = ActorID("Wolf", "Critter")
			ChangeActor(Player, ID)

			; Wait 10 seconds
			DoEvents(10000)

			; Turn him back into whatever he was before
			ChangeActor(Player, OldID)

			Return()
		End Function
