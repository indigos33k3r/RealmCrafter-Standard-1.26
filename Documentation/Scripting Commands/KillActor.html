	<b> KillActor </b>
	</font>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		KillActor(Actor, [KillerActor])</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The KillActor command is an easy way to kill an actor and automatically calculate XP and
	any faction rating hit for the killer. If you do not specify an actor for the optional
	KillerActor parameter, this is exactly the same as using
	<a href="SetAttribute.html">SetAttribute</a> to set the actor's health to zero. If you are
	applying scripted damage (e.g. in an ability script or a custom attack script) but do not
	want to manually calculate XP and the faction rating hit, use this command to kill the actor
	before your scripted damage otherwise makes its health go to zero. <br>
	Another advantage of using this command is that if you have set a death script for the dead
	actor, it will be called with the handle of the killer actor as the
	<a href="ContextActor.html">ContextActor</a>. If you choose not to use this command (e.g. to
	customise the formula used to calculate XP points) you will have to call the death script
	via <a href="ThreadExecute.html">ThreadExecute</a> in order to pass the handle of the killer.

	<b>Example:</b> <br>
	<pre>
		Function Main()
			; The player kills the context actor
			KillActor(ContextActor(), Actor())
			Return()
		End Function
