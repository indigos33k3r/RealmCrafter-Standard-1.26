<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		CreateEmitter(Actor, Emitter, TextureID, Time, [OffsetX], [OffsetY], [OffsetZ], [DisplayActor])</pre>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The CreateEmitter command spawns a particles emitter. It can be attached to an actor
	or set to a fixed position in space. This is useful for spell casting and
	other visual effects. The emitter will be visible to all nearby players. <br>
	The Actor parameter is the handle of an actor to attach the emitter to. If this is
	zero, the emitter will be set to the offset co-ordinates and will not move. If an
	actor handle is supplied, the emitter will be attached to that actor and move where
	it moves. The Emitter parameter is the name of the emitter to create. The TextureID
	is the texture to use for the particles. You can see a texture's ID number in the
	Media tab of the main editor. The Time parameter is the amount of time (in
	milliseconds) that the emitter will last before disappearing. The optional offsets
	are the position in the zone, or the offsets from the centre of the actor, that the
	emitter will appear at. You can find the position of points in a zone by looking at the
	camera position in the lower right corner of the Zones tab in the main editor. <br>
	The final optional DisplayActor parameter allows you to specify a single player actor
	to whom the emitter will appear, rather than appearing to all players in a zone. The emitter
	can still be attached to other actors as usual with the Actor parameter.
