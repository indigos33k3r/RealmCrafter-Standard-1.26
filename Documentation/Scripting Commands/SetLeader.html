	<b> SetLeader </b>

<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		SetLeader(Actor, Leader)</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The SetLeader command sets the 'owner' of an specified actor. To make
	the actor free (i.e. no leader), specify 0 for the Leader parameter. Otherwise,
	you should provide a valid actor handle for the leader. When an actor has a leader,
	it will follow it around, attack what it attacks, and so on. When a player logs off,
	any actors who have that player as their leader will be removed from the game as well,
	and will reappear when the player logs back in. Only NPCs can be given a leader, but
	the leader itself can be an NPC.

	<b>Example:</b> <br>
	<pre>
		Function Main()
			SetLeader(ContextActor(), Actor())
			Output(Actor(), "You gained a pet!")
			Return()
		End Function
	</pre>
