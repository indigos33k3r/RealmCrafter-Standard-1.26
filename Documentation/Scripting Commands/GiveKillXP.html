<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		GiveKillXP(Actor, TargetActor)</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The GiveKillXP command gives experience points to actor. It works on both
	player characters and NPCs. The actor will increase in level if you
	give them enough points. <br>
	The difference between this command and <a href="GiveXP.html">GiveXP</a> is
	that instead of specifying an exact number of XP points, you specify a
	target actor. The number of XP points assigned will be the number that would
	be assigned if the actor killed the target actor. This is convenient to let
	the RC engine automatically calculate XP points as it normally does, without
	having to use KillActor (e.g. in a custom combat script). <br>
	The target actor is not affected by the use of this command.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Example:</b> <br>
	<pre>
		Function Main()
			; Give the player the XP points for killing the NPC, and kill the NPC
			NPC = ContextActor()
			GiveKillXP(Actor(), NPC)
			SetAttribute(NPC, "Health", 0)
			Return()
		End Function
