<p>
	<b>Usage:</b> <br>
	<pre>		NextActorInZone(ActorHandle)</pre>
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The NextActorInZone command returns a handle to the next actor in the same zone
	as the specified actor. This is useful to very quickly iterate through all
	actors in a single zone. Unlike <a href="NextActor.html">NextActor</a>,
	this command will loop infinitely through the actors in a zone, rather than
	returning 0 when the last actor is reached. Because of this you must check
	when you reach the original actor rather than when you reach 0. <br>
	See also <a href="FirstActorInZone.html">FirstActorInZone</a>.

<p>
	<b>Example:</b> <br>
	<pre>
		Function Main()
			; Send a message to every human actor in the same zone as the player
			Player = Actor()
			Actor = NextActorInZone(Player)
			If (Actor != Player)
				.Loop
				If (ActorIsHuman(Actor))
					Output(Actor, "Hello there!")
				EndIf
				Actor = NextActorInZone(Actor)
				If (Actor != Player)
					GoTo(Loop)
				EndIf
			EndIf
			Return()
		End Function
