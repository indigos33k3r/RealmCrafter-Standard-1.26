	<pre>		Parameter(Number)</pre>

	<b>Description:</b> <br>
	The Parameter command allows you to retrieve command line parameters for scripts. The main use of this command
	is in custom in-game command scripts, where it allows you to get user input. For instance, if you had a custom
	command named "test", and a player entered "/test Paul, 17", there would be two valid parameters which you would
	retrieve using Parameter(1) and Parameter(2). Parameter(3) and upwards would return nothing. <br><br>
	It is also used in the following: <br><br>
	Ability scripts - there is one parameter: the player's level in the ability. <br>
	NPC death scripts - there are 15 parameters: the race and class of the dead actor, followed by the X, Y and Z
	positions, followed by its ten actor globals. <br>
	<a href="ThreadExecute.html">ThreadExecute</a> - ThreadExecute can pass a set of parameters to the script it runs, which can then be accessed
	with this command. <br>
	Triggered scripts - these scripts receive one parameter containing the ID of the trigger which called the script
</p>

	<b>Example:</b> <br>
	<pre>
		Function Main()
			; Get damage of spell
			SpellLvl = Parameter(1)
			Damage = 10 + SpellLvl

			; Tell player
			Output(Actor(), "You do " $+ Damage $+ " damage...")

			Return()
		End Function
