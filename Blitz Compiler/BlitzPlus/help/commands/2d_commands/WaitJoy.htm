<h1>Description</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
This command makes your program halt until a jpystick button is pressed  on the joystick. Used alone, it simply halts and waits for a button press. It  can also be used to assign the pressed button&#39;s code value to a variable. See  example.<br />
 <br />
 In MOST CASES, you are not going to want to use this command because chances  are likely you are going to want things on the screen still happening while  awaiting the button press. In that situation, you&#39;ll use a WHILE ... WEND awaiting  a JoyHit value - refreshing your screen each loop.<br />
 <br />
 As with any joystick command, you MUST have a DirectX compatible joystick plugged  in and properly configured within Windows for it to work. See your joystick  documentation for more information.
