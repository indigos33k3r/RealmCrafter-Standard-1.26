<h1>Description</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
This command will halt execution until the timer generates the next tick event, unless an unprocessed tick event is outstanding, in which case execution continues immediately.  <br />
<br />
Use this in conjunction with the <a class=small href=../2d_commands/CreateTimer.htm>CreateTimer</a> command. This is useful to control the execution speed of your program. It will wait until a timer tick event is received, or, if there are outstanding timer tick events, it will return the number of timer tick events that have passed since last being called.<br />
<br />
This command should not be used in GUI based applications, as any other events that may occur<br />
before the timer event will go missing. Instead, GUI based applications should use <a class=small href=../gui_commands/WaitEvent.htm>WaitEvent</a> to<br />
monitor timers.  You should never use both WaitEvent and WaitTimer at the same timer, as you may 'lose' timer tick events.<br />
<br />
WaitTimer can not be used with a paused timer.
