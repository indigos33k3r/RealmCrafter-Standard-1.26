<h1>PlayMusic (filename$[,flags])</h1>
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
filename$ - name of music file. Formats supported:  raw/mod/s3m/xm/it/mid/rmi/wav/mp2/mp3/ogg/wma/asf<br />
flags = optional playback flags
</td>

<h1>Description</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
This command will load and play a music file.<br />
<br />
You can't 'preload' the audio like you can a sound sample via the LoadSound command. Every time you call the PlayMusic  command, the file is reloaded and played. This means that if you use the command  while some graphics are moving on-screen, you may get a slight pause when the  hard drive seeks and grabs the music file. To avoid this, you might want to  use the PlaySound/LoopSound  commands instead.<br />
<br />
The returned value is a 'channel handle'. Various channel commands allow you to modifiy the music<br />
while it is playing in realtime.<br />
<br />
The optional flags variable can be of the following values:<br />
<br />
1: Loop the music<br />
2: Initially pause the music<br />
3: Loop and pause the music<br />
<br />
If a paused flag is specified, you must use ResumeChannel to actually start the audio output.<br />
<br />
Pausing music before playback allows you to setup various channel parameters before the music<br />
actually starts playing.
