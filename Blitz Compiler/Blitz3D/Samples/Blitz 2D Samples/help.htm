<p>BLOGO is a simple port of the LOGO interpreter for the BBC Micro. It was a 
  language with only a few commands that let children control an on-screen 'turtle' 
  to draw shapes and teach them about programming (oh, and all the maths/spacial 
  ability stuff ;) )</p>
<p>I wrote BLOGO in a couple of hours, in a mad rush to get something done for 
  the Blitz Basic CD mere days before the deadline (which explains the quality 
  of the program ;) )adding in all the commands I could remember from the old 
  BBC. This really goes to show how easy Blitz Basic is, as the code does some 
  things that would have taken me days to work out in C++/C :)</p>
<p>The commands for BLOGO are very simple, and all have a short version and a 
  long version, so you can remember them easily. For instance, the <b>forwards</b> 
  command can either be typed as <b>forwards </b>or <b>fd</b> , so people new 
  to the program have an obvious command, and later on they can save time with 
  the two-letter command.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, I'll give you the commands listing:</p>
<p><img src="commands.jpg" width="132" height="25"></p>
<p><i>NOTE: &lt;x&gt; can be an integer or the name of a variable, &lt;p&gt; is 
  a percentage, and &lt;screenx&gt; and &lt;screeny&gt; are positions on the screen, 
  where 0,0 is the middle, the scale going from -100 to +100. &lt;name&gt; is 
  a string.</i></p>
<p><b>fd </b><i>or </i><b>forwards </b>&lt;x&gt; - move forwards &lt;x&gt;</p>
<p><b>bk </b><i>or </i><b>backwards </b>&lt;x&gt; - move backwards &lt;x&gt;</p>
<p><b>lt </b><i>or </i><b>left </b>&lt;x&gt; - turn left &lt;x&gt;</p>
<p><b>rt </b><i> or </i><b>right </b>&lt;x&gt; - turn right &lt;x&gt;</p>
<p><b>define </b>&lt;name&gt; - define a function with the name &lt;name&gt;. 
  Enter commands as normal, then type the <b>end</b> command to finish defining 
  the function. Functions can be called by simply typing their name and pressing 
  <b>Return</b>.</p>
<p><b>wipe </b><i>or </i><b>clear </b><i>or </i><b>cls </b>- clears the screen 
  of all drawings</p>
<p><b>move </b>&lt;screenx&gt;,&lt;screeny&gt; - positions the turtle at &lt;screenx&gt;,&lt;screeny&gt;</p>
<p><b>red </b>&lt;p&gt; - sets the redness of the ink colour</p>
<p><b>green </b>&lt;p&gt; - sets the greenness of the ink colour</p>
<p><b>blue </b>&lt;p&gt;. - sets the blueness of the ink colour</p>
<p><b>what </b><i>or </i><b>print </b><i>or </i><b>value </b>&lt;name&gt; - displays 
  the value of variable &lt;name&gt;</p>
<p><b>run</b> &lt;name&gt; - reads commands from file &lt;name&gt;</p>
<p><b>quit</b> - quits BLOGO</p>
<p><i>VARIABLES</i></p>
<p>Variables don't need to be declared, and they can be set by using the command 
  &lt;name&gt; <b>= </b>&lt;x&gt;</p>
