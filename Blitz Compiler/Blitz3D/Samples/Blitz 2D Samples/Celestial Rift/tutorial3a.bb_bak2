AppTitle "Celestial Rift - Version 1.1 (C)2001 Myke P" ;what this program will be called in MICROSOFT WINDOWS.

;This makes two CONSTants. These are values which will NOT change at any point in the program, so we set their values now.
Const SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
Const SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
;This is the code which tells Blitz what Display Resolution to use on the Graphics Card. The "GRAPHICS" command should always be placed before you do
;*anything* image-related in your program
Graphics SCREEN_WIDTH,SCREEN_HEIGHT,0,1	;start the graphics mode at SCREEN_WIDTH by SCREEN_HEIGHT, let Blitz choose the depth (,0) and run full screen (,1)

;more program CONSTants..
Const GAME_AREA_X = 50000	;these two set the size of the map. You *should* keep them the same, 'cos the radar is square
Const GAME_AREA_Y = 50000	;but technically, you can change the values to anything you like! ;)
;the following constants are keyboard "SCAN" codes. Every key on the keyboard has a number. You can get the full list in your Blitz manual.
Const KEY_CLOCKWISE = 25	;(p)	
Const KEY_ANTICWISE = 24	;(o)
Const KEY_SPEEDUP = 16		;(q)
Const KEY_SPEEDDOWN = 30	;(a)
Const KEY_FIRE = 57			;(Space)
Const KEY_QUIT = 1			;(Escape)
Const KEY_PAUSE = 7			;(Number 6 on the main keyboard)
Const KEY_DEBUG = 59		;(F1)
Const KEY_SAVESCREEN = 88	;(F12)
;the following constants affect the way the game plays. Feel free to mess with the values..
Const ENEMY_MAX_DIST = 5000
Const ENEMY_MIN_DIST = 50
Const INCR_ROTATE# = 5				;.. but DON'T touch this, otherwise the game will crash (I only drew the animation frames for 5 degree intervals!)
Const INCR_SPEED# = 0.5
Const INCR_SLOW# = 0.125

timer = CreateTimer(50) ;create a timer set at 50ms (game speed) - play with this to see how you can increase or decrease the speed of the game.
						;this should be set at a speed which will look near enough the same on *every* PC it will be played on.
						;My PC (a 733MHz PIII with an nVidia GeForce card) will handle upwards of 150 frames per second, quite happily
						;but 'lesser' machines will not. 50, therefore, is quite sensible For a game of this nature, who's minimum system spec
						;will be something like a PII 300MHz machine (i.e.: Blitz Basic's minimum spec!)

;NOTE: there's no need to organise your variable declarations, as I have here, into sections. They can appear in any order you like, before the main program begins.
;I just do this, 'cos it looks right professional! :))))

;picture/animation (and related) variables
Global game_background
Global game_player
Global game_enemy1

;Types are like Structures in C. You have a "Type" called whatever. Then you can make multiple versions of the type. Each version of the Type has the same properties, i.e.:
;a FISH (the Type) has EYES, MOUTH, SCALES And FINS (it's properties) - ALL FISH have these properties.
;a DOG (the Type) has EYES, MOUTH, FUR and TAIL (it's properties) - ALL DOGS have these properties (look like this.)

Type enemies					;same for enemies
	Field x#,y#,energy,angle,speed#,style,maxspeed,dest_angle,dist_travelled,dist_to_go,dest_opp#,dest_hyp#,dest_adj#,rotate_angle,status,bulletlimiter,exp_frame#,gen
End Type
;notice the "enemies" Type has a "style"?
;originally, I planned to have different styles of enemy space-ships, but never got around to drawing the graphics!
;the "style" is used in the subsequent code, and the Type property remains, so *technically* adding new enemy styles to the game should be pretty easy! :)
For i = 1 To 10
	enemy.enemies = New enemies ;make 10 enemies (we'll set their variables later)
