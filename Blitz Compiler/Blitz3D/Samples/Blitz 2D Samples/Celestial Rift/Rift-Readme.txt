This game, its source and tutorials are released as FREEWARE. This means

**INFO********************************************************************

This game was written in around 10 days using Blitz Basic (version 1.48)
and has subsequently been recompiled (and debugged) using version 1.50.

It is my first ever game and designed to be simplistic, so that it could
be used as the model for a three-issue article in PC Format Magazine (UK).

It's a top-down 360 degree space shooter, with frantic HiScore based
gameplay.

**THE GAME****************************************************************

Not a lot to say! You start the game having Hyperjumped into a hostile
space system. Needless to say, the locals aren't the friendliest bunch
(wouldn't be much of a game if they drove their ships up to you and
invited you for lunch!) and they immediately make a beeline for you on
a mission to kill.

It's time to kill back!

**INSTRUCTIONS************************************************************

You've got a limited amount of shielding before you're toast, but to help
you stay alive, you've also got some tricks up your sleeve:

1. The Hyperdrive
    This will transport you to another random (not necessarily safe)
    part of local space. Useful for getting out of 10-on-1 situations.
    You start the game with 5 Hyperdrive tokens (which means you can
    jump 5 times before you will find it doesn't work!)
2. The Cloaking Device
    This renders you invisible to the enemy for a limited period (shown
    by the coloured bar labelled Cloak). During this period, enemies
    will fly straight by you - but beware, they'll also fly straight
    through you (which costs Shield, so watch out.)
3. The Boosters
    Quite simply enables you to go faster than normal (for a similarly
    limited period.) Useful for outrunning the faster, more aggressive
    locals!

All of these, plus the shields can be replenished during the game by
collecting the pulsating icons that appear in the game (spherical,
colourful and with a suitable letter etched into it). These are shown
by the PURPLE dots on the radar.

The enemy ships are shown by the RED dots on the radar and you are shown
as GREEN. Keep an eye on it!

The game is controlled by the Keyboard (remember, keeping it simple for
the tutorial) using the following:
Q   - Faster
A   - Slower
O   - Rotate Left
P   - Rotate Right
Spc - Fire Weapons
C   - Cloak
M   - Booster
1   - Hyperdrive

6   - Pause Game
Esc - Quit Game/Menu

(Additionally, you can press F1 on the main menu to play a version of
the game with the debug option on!)

The Enemies, unfortunately, have an unlimited resource of attack ships,
so when you've defeated one, it won't be long before another is on its
way. As if it were any help, there will only be 10 of them at any one
point.

Sadly, you haven't got a hope in hell of getting out of this alive, so
it's stiff upper lip time, old boy. Do us proud and go out in a blaze 
of glory. You're HiScore will be remembered (on disk) forever (or until
some clever people alter the rift.dat file)

**GOOD LUCK***************************************************************

I hope you enjoy the game and if not, I hope the tutorial is helpful. ;)
