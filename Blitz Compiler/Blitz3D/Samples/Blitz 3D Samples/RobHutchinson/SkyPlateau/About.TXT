Blitz3D Demonstration.
Inspired by Unreal :)

This program was written in the space of about 5
days or so (including all models, textures (a few
borrowed from other B3D examples),
sounds, and BBLauncher(vb)), with Blitz Basic 
Beta V1.60.

So what features does it show off?

- Spherical Environment Mapping.
- Alpha Blending.
- Fogging.
- Ping-Pong Mesh Deformation Animations.
- Unlimited Length Planes.
- Directional/Point Lighting.
- Light Ranging.
- Sprites.
- X/MD2 Loader.
- Tonnes of Pivoting..
- But most importantly, how fast Blitz3D is!

What are the controls?

Its a rolling (spinning :)) demo, so theres not
much interaction, but you can navigate the menu
with the up and down arrow keys, select a menu
option with the enter key. And quick-exit with
the escape key. Mouselook option allows you to
look around with the mouse, and the Pause Rot
option allows to you pause the rotation so you
can look around without spinning.

Have fun watching it!
